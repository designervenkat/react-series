# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- JSX Notes -->

# JSX - Javascript XML it is language syntax

# write HTML-Like code for element and components

# JSX tags have name , attributes and children

# JSX is not a necessity to write react app

# JSX make your code simpler and elegant

# JSX ultimately transpile to pure javascript which is under the hood for browser by using babel

# What is JSX?

### JSX, or JavaScript XML, is an extension of JavaScript syntax that allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax similar to XML or HTML. Itâ€™s a game-changer in the React world, as it provides a concise and expressive way to describe the structure of your user interface.

### JS Experssion Final outcome will inside JSX expression

# Embedding Expressions

### JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces {}. This is handy for injecting dynamic content:

# Class vs. className

### In JSX, use className instead of class to define CSS classes:

# Why Use JSX?

### Readability: JSX makes your code more readable and resembles the structure of your UI.

### Expressiveness: It allows you to express complex UI structures in a concise manner.

### JavaScript Power: JSX is essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript, leveraging its full power within expressions.

# use cases

### Dynamic Content: By using expressions in JSX, you can create dynamic and interactive UIs that change based on the values of your variables and data.

### Code Reusability: Expressions allow you to reuse code and avoid repeating the same logic multiple times.

### Conditional Rendering: You can use expressions to conditionally render elements in your UI based on certain conditions, such as data values or user interactions.

# Return Single Element.

# div/section/article or React Fragment.

# Use camelCase for HTML Attribute.

# className Instead of Class.

# Close Every Element.

# Formatting.

# Tags are elements.
